                    5 NBA Finals takeaways so far from Celtics-Mavericks
                </p>
                <p class="banner-description">
                    The Boston Celtics were a heavy favorite entering the 2024 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks,
                    and through two games they’ve cemented the idea that they’re the better team. The Celtics proved
                    they could deliver an early knockout punch in Game 1, when they blitzed the Mavs from the opening
                    tip and turned the game into a rout before halftime. In Game 2, the Celtics showed that they can win
                    even when they’re not having their best offensive night.

                <p class="blog-desc">Over the past several years, KSHMR has established himself as a dominant force in
                    modern EDM. Keeping a tight release schedule paired with countless performances all year round, as
                    well as giving back to the producer community with his massive Sounds of KSHMR sample packs, the
                    producer (real name Niles Hollowell-Dhar) definitely knows to keep busy. </p>
                <p class="blog-desc">This interesting article on Bloomberg talks about how much time we spend in
                    meetings daily, and guess what? Very often we dedicate more than 2 hours a day which actually can be
                    more than most workers need. Now, luckily, after moving the majority of daily meetings to Zoom and
                    Google Meets, a lot of tension is released, because virtual meetings do not require one to sit still
                    and literally stop working for hours. You can join the meeting by opening it on the first half of
                    your desktop and leaving the rest of the space for other tasks to be done simultaneously. </p>

                    indifferent about this issue in times when cyber attacks and information leaks are so frequent, even
                    for tech giants like Google and Microsoft.</p>

                    of communication. What we mean is that especially after the global COVID pandemic, when companies
                    adapted to the digitized world and started working remotely or in a hybrid mode, the face of their
                    communication changed accordingly.</p>

                    For me, story and music go hand in hand. I see a story in my mind when I listen to great songs.
                    Whenever I'm making a song, I'm trying to break through to that moment when a story begins to
                    appear. For my live show, I can actually show people a story, fully animated with an original score
                    that weaves in and out of the music. It's special and important to me.
